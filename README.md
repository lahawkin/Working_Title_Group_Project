# Working_Title_Group_Project
An e commerce site to emphasize the ease of use for the buyer.  A group project.

## Getting Started

To get the git repo locally, in an empty folder
`git init`
`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Working_Title_Group_Project.git`

It should download the whole React application that I created.
